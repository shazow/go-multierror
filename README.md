# go-multierror

**Status**: The original intended design of this library was [fatally
flawed](https://github.com/shazow/go-multierror/issues/2), now that it's fixed
it's reduced to being very similar to existing popular solutions:

* [github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror)
* [github.com/joeshaw/multierror](https://github.com/joeshaw/multierror)

I suggest using one of those instead.
